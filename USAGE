Description:
    The 'hightail' command creates a new Rails application with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

Example:
    hightail ~/Code/Ruby/weblog

    This generates a skeletal Rails installation in ~/Code/Ruby/weblog.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
